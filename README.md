# Compound Interest Calculator
I've been teaching my kid about compound interest and thought I would use a simple Python
script to walk him through the math step by step. This could be simplified quite a bit by
combining the calculations into a single line, not displaying the values that were just
entered, etc.  

Starting with Python, next will convert to JavaScript/HTML to make it a bit more user friendly. 

Then maybe Microsoft BASIC just for fun.
